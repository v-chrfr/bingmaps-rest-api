The Bingâ„¢ Maps REST Services Application Programming Interface (API) is a Representational State Transfer (REST) API that you can use to do common tasks, such as finding an address, retrieving a map with a pushpin and a label, or getting driving directions. You perform these tasks by constructing a URL..  
  
 **To use the Bing Maps REST Services, you must have a [Bing Maps Key](~/docs-ref-content/getting-started/getting-a-bing-maps-key.md).**
