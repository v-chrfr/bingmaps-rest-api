|April 15, 2014<br /><br /> [Calculate a Route](../how-to/calculate-a-route.md)|<ul><li>A routeAttributes parameter is added. This takes one or more of the following values:<br /><br /> <ul><li>`excludeItinerary`: Specifies to not return itinerary items in the response.</li><li>`routePath`: Specifies to return a set of coordinates (`latitude,longitude`) that define the route. This route attribute gives the same result as setting `routePathOutput=Points` in the request and is now the recommended way to get route path coordinates (see note below).</li></ul></li><li>A mfa (metadata for alternate routes) is added. When set to 1 (true), detailed route instructions (itinerary items) are not included in the response for alternate routes.</li><li>Route sub-leg fields are added to provide summary information for the route leg segments between start and end waypoints and any intermediate via-waypoints</li></ul>|
