# Get a Static Map
Use the following URL templates to get a static map. You can also display a route on a static map, and you can request static map metadata. Static map metadata includes the absolute (latitude and longitude) and relative (with respect to the map) coordinates and size of pushpins as well as the map area and center point.  
  
## Supported HTTP Methods

GET, POST

POST requests require all parameters to be passed into the body of the request as a JSON object. This API is [CORs enabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing).

## URL Templates  
 The default map size is 350 pixels by 350 pixels.  
  
> [!Note]
> These templates support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. To use this API, you must have a [Bing Maps key](../getting-started/getting-a-bing-maps-key.md). 
  
 **Static map metadata**: To get the size and center point of the image and the locations and size of the pushpins on the map, set the mapMetadata parameter to 1 (true). When you request static map metadata, the metadata is returned instead of the map image.  
  
 **Get a map that is centered at a specified point.**  
  
 When you specify a center point, you must also specify a zoom level.  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/{imagerySet}/{centerPoint}/{zoomLevel}?mapSize={mapSize}&pushpin={pushpin_1}&pushpin={pushpin_2}&mapLayer={mapLayer}&format={format}&mapMetadata={mapMetadata}&key={BingMapsKey}  
```  
  
 **Get a map that shows a specified map area.**  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/{imagerySet}?pushpin={pushpin_1}&pushpin={pushpin_2}&pushpin={pushpin_n}&mapArea={mapArea}&mapSize={mapSize}&mapLayer={mapLayer}&format={format}&mapMetadata={mapMetadata}&key={BingMapsKey} 
```  
  
 **Get a map with pushpins that does not specify a center point or map area.**  
  
 If you do not specify a center point or map area, the map area is chosen to optimize the display of the pusphins.  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/{imagerySet}?pushpin={pushpin_1}&pushpin={pushpin_2}&pushpin={pushpin_n}&mapSize={mapSize}&mapLayer={mapLayer}&format={format}&mapMetadata={mapMetadata}&key={BingMapsKey}  
```  
  
 **Get a map that is centered at the specified point and that displays a route.**  
  
 You can display a route on a map by specifying a set of waypoints.  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/{imagerySet}/{centerPoint}/{zoomLevel}/Routes/{travelMode}?waypoint.1={waypoint1}&waypoint.2={waypoint2}&waypoint.n={wWaypointN}&mapSize={mapSize}&avoid={avoidOptions}&pushpin={pushpin_1}&pushpin={pushpin_2}&pushpin={pushpin_n}&timeType={timeType}&dateTime={dateTime}&maxSolutions={maxSolutions}&distanceBeforeFirstTurn={distanceBeforeFirstTurn}&mapLayer={mapLayer}&format={format}&mapMetadata={mapMetadata}&key={BingMapsKey}   
```  
  
 **Get a map that displays a route without specifying a center point. You can choose to specify the map area or you can accept the default.**  
  
 You can display a route on a map by specifying a set of waypoints. When a map area or a center point and a zoom level are not specified, a map area is chosen to optimize the display of the route.  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/{imagerySet}/Routes/{travelMode}?waypoint.1={waypoint1}&waypoint.2={waypoint2}&waypoint.n={wWaypointN}&mapSize={mapSize}&mapArea={mapArea}&avoid={avoidOptions}&pushpin={pushpin_1}&pushpin={pushpin_2}&pushpin={pushpin_n}&timeType={timeType}&dateTime={dateTime}&maxSolutions={maxSolutions}&distanceBeforeFirstTurn={distanceBeforeFirstTurn}&mapLayer={mapLayer}&format={format}&mapMetadata={mapMetadata}&key={BingMapsKey}  
```  
  
 **Get a map that is based on a query.**  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/{imagerySet}/{query}?mapSize={mapSize}&mapLayer={mapLayer}&format={format}&mapMetadata={mapMetadata}&key={BingMapsKey}   
```  
  
 **Pushpin limits**: If you use HTTP GET method with the following URL templates, you can specify up to 18 pushpins in the URL. If you want to specify more than 18 pushpins, use the HTTP POST method and specify up to 100 pushpins in the body of the HTTP POST request. If you use the HTTP POST method, all pushpins must be in the body of the request and not in the URL, and you must set the Content-Type to “text/plain” and the charset to “UTF-8” in the HTTP header. For a sample request, see the **Examples** section.  
  
### Template Parameters  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  See the [Common Parameters and Types](../services/common-parameters-and-types.md) section for additional common parameters to use with these URLs.

 **Get a map that displays pushpins by using the HTTP POST Method**  
  
 The following example shows how to request a static map by using the HTTP POST method. When you use this method, you can specify up to 100 pushpins. All pushpins must be in the body of the request. Because the request does not specify a map area or center point and zoom level, the map area is optimized to show all of the pushpins.  
  
 **HTTP POST URL**  
  
```  
https://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/v1/Imagery/Map/Road/?key=BingMapsKey  
```  
  
 **HTTP POST Header**  
  
 You must include the following settings in the HTTP POST Header.  
  
```  
Content-Length: insertLengthOfHTTPBody  
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8  
```  
  
 **HTTP POST Body**  
  
 When specifying pushpins in the request body, you can use a carriage return (\r\n) or an ampersand (&) as a delimiter. The following two examples show these options.  
  
 **Example 1**  
  
```  
pp=38.889586530732335,-77.05010175704956;23;LM\r\n  
pp=38.88772364638439,-77.0472639799118;7;KM\r\n  
pp=38.890479451480054,-77.04744637012482;1;VM\r\n  
pp=38.8896854931628,-77.03519403934479;45;WM  
  
```  
  
 **Example 2**  
  
```  
pp=38.889586530732335,-77.05010175704956;23;LM&pp=38.88772364638439,-77.0472639799118;7;KM\r\n  
pp=38.890479451480054,-77.04744637012482;1;VM&pp=38.8896854931628,-77.03519403934479;45;WM  
  
```
